# What is QGreenland Custom?

QGreenland is a free and open-source Greenland-focused GIS environment for data
analysis and viewing, powered by [QGIS](https://qgis.org). QGreenland is
delivered in two ways:

1. **QGreenland Core**: a large Zip package containing a core set of data
   curated to serve the majority of users. This documentation page is about
   QGreenland Core. QGreenland Core has its own
   [documentation](https://qgreenland.readthedocs.io).

2. **QGreenland Custom (beta)**: a QGIS plugin for downloading a custom set of
   data, including data which is not part of the QGreenland Core zip package
   (for example, due to filesize constraints). QGreenland Custom enables you to 
   access only the QGreenland layers you are interested in.
