# Development install

Install the plugin by symlinking this repository to your plugins directory,
e.g.:

```
ln -s $PWD ~/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins/.
```

Then in the QGIS "Manage and Install Plugins..." dialog's "Installed" tab,
ensure the "QGreenland" plugin is enabled (checked).
